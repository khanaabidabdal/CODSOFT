# CODSOFT

The following repository contains the projects assigned by the code soft for Machine Learning Internship : 

* 1)Spam Classification : In this project I trained models like Logistic Regression,Pytorch and Naive Bayes to classify the SMS as spam or ham. In this project Iâ€™m able to get the accuracy 98% on the test data set using Naive Bayes.
* 2)Movie Genre Classification : In this project I build a model to classify the genre of movie into 17 different Categories. The data set has 13K data samples for Drama and Documentary and less than 200 samples for war and news. The dataset is largely unbalanced because  of that I got only 59% accuracy on the Test Set.
* 3)Digit Generation : It was my first project where I worked on Generative Ai. In this project I used GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) where two models, one discriminator and another generator compete with each other. Generator creates fake images and tries to fool the discriminator. On the other hand, the discriminator acts as detective and tries to identify the fake images created by the generator.
